This repo is intended to be practice for setting up a basic trading algo to be used with Coinbase PRO, following various tutorials I found online.

Some things I learned so far getting the basics set up:
- the cbpro module is not compatible with python 3.11 (or even 3.10), so I had to install and use pyenv to change my global python version on my machine to 3.9
